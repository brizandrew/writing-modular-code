# Final App
This is what your app inside `5-my-app` should look like after completing the guide. You can use this directory as a reference or a starting template for future projects of your own.

The actual node_modules themselves aren't in this directory because they are too big. Remember they can be downloaded via a simple `npm install` command once you've navigated into this directory.
